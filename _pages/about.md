I was born and raised in Barcelona, Spain where I have lived my entire life. I initially started my bachelor’s degree in Telecommunications Engineering but soon realized it wasn’t the right fit for me, and now I've decided to pursue a career on applied maths and I hope I'll be working in finance after finishing my studies. I am looking forward on moving to the Netherlands to study applied maths and staying there for a couple years.

In my spare time, I enjoy going to the gym, training kickboxing, grappling, mountain bike and hanging out with my friends.

I will be applying to bachelor programs in mathematics soon. Here is my github, and I can be reached at sergioalborsjuez@gmail.com
